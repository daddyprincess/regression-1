    "Linear regression is based on several key assumptions, and it's essential to check whether these assumptions hold in a \n",
    "given dataset to ensure the validity of your regression analysis. The primary assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (response) is \n",
    "  assumed to be linear. This means that changes in the predictors should result in proportional changes in the response\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: You can visually assess linearity using scatterplots of the response variable against each \n",
    "     independent variable. A pattern that resembles a straight line suggests linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should be independent of each\n",
    " other. This assumption implies that there should be no autocorrelation or patterns in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: Examine residual plots to ensure there are no clear patterns, trends, or cycles. You can also use\n",
    "     statistical tests for autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of \n",
    "  the independent variables. In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same throughout the range of\n",
    "predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or each independent variable. Look for a consistent\n",
    "     spread of points, with no noticeable funnel shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality of Residuals: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is necessary for making\n",
    "  valid statistical inferences and hypothesis tests about the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: You can create a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and compare them to a normal distribution.\n",
    "     You can also perform formal statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No or Little Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in the regression\n",
    "  model are highly correlated with each other. This can make it challenging to isolate the individual effects of the \n",
    "predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: Calculate correlation coefficients between pairs of independent variables. If correlations are very\n",
    "     high (close to 1 or -1), it may indicate multicollinearity.\n",

    "6.No Endogeneity: The independent variables should be exogenous, meaning they are not influenced by the error term in\n",
    "  the regression equation. Endogeneity can lead to biased coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~How to check: Careful model specification and theoretical understanding are necessary to address this assumption.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ~SLR Equation: In SLR, the relationship is expressed as a straight line, with one slope (b) and one intercept (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~MLR Equation: In MLR, the relationship is expressed as a plane (in 3D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions). It\n",

    "    variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~SLR: Simpler to understand and visualize since it involves only one independent variable. It's suitable when you \n",
    "     want to model a relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~MLR: More complex as it involves multiple independent variables. It's used when you need to account for the\n",
    "     influence of multiple factors simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~SLR: The interpretation of coefficients is straightforward. For example, in Y=a+bX,b represents the change in Y \n",
    "     for a one-unit change in X.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~MLR: Interpretation becomes more complex since there are multiple independent variables. The interpretation of \n",

    "    change in Y for a one-unit change in X1, assuming X2 is held constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~SLR: Useful when you want to model a simple linear relationship between two variables, such as predicting\n",
    "     temperature based on hours of sunlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~MLR: Suitable when you have multiple factors influencing the dependent variable. Common applications include\n",
    "     predicting house prices based on various features (square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) or\n",
    "    predicting sales based on factors like advertising spending, pricing, and seasonality.\n",

    "In summary, multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows you to model the \n",

    "Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used when the relationship between the independent variable(s) \n",
    "and the dependent variable is not linear but follows a polynomial curve. In contrast to simple linear regression, where\n",
    "the relationship is modeled as a straight line, polynomial regression allows for a more flexible and curved relationship\n",
    "between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key characteristics and differences between polynomial regression and linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity vs. Curvature:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Linear Regression: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the \n",
    "     dependent variable. It models this relationship as a straight line, which means the change in the dependent \n",
    "    variable is constant for a one-unit change in the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression accommodates curved relationships by introducing higher-degree\n",
    "     polynomial terms (e.g., quadratic, cubic) of the independent variable(s). These polynomial terms allow the model \n",
    "    to capture curvature in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Linear Regression Equation: The equation for simple linear regression is Y=a+bX, where Y is the dependent variable,\n",
    "     X is the independent variable, a is the intercept, and b is the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Polynomial Regression Equation: The equation for polynomial regression can have additional terms of the form bkXk,\n",
    "     where k represents the degree of the polynomial. For example, a quadratic polynomial regression model would have\n",
    "    an equation like Y=a+b1X+b2X2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Linear Regression: Linear regression is simpler to understand and interpret because it assumes a linear\n",
    "     relationship. It works well for modeling simple linear trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression introduces complexity due to the inclusion of higher-degree terms. The\n",
    "     interpretation of coefficients becomes more intricate as the degree of the polynomial increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fitting Curved Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Linear Regression: Linear regression is not suitable for capturing complex, curved relationships in the data. It \n",
    "     may provide a poor fit when the underlying relationship is nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression is designed to fit data with curves and can provide a better fit for\n",
    "     such data. The degree of the polynomial can be adjusted to match the complexity of the underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Linear Regression: Linear regression models are less prone to overfitting because they assume a simple\n",
    "     relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Polynomial Regression: Higher-degree polynomial regression models can be prone to overfitting, especially when \n",
    "     the degree is too high relative to the amount of data. Regularization techniques can be used to mitigate\n",
    "    overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while linear regression assumes a linear relationship between variables and models it as a straight line, \n",
    "polynomial regression allows for curved relationships by introducing higher-degree polynomial terms. Polynomial \n",
    "regression is a useful tool when the true relationship between variables is not linear and can provide a better fit to\n",
    "the data in such cases. However, it's important to choose an appropriate degree for the polynomial to avoid overfitting."
